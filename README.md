A theremin is a musical instrument that can be played without physical contact beween the muscian and the instrument. They were first invented by Leon Theremin in 1920. 
They have two antennasâ€”one that controls frequency, and the another that controls volume. When you move your hands near the antennas, you interact with their electromagnetic 
fields, which alters the sound using radio-frequency oscillators. In my version, instead of using electromagentic fields, I am using ultrasonic sensors. These sensors 
send out a high frequency sound wave and calculate how long it took to come back after hitting an object. By moving your hand infront of the sensors, you can alter the 
frequency of the sound waves, creating music. One of the sensors alters frequency, and the other turns it on and off, just like in a tradtional theremin.

The attached image shows how to wire and set up the theremin.
